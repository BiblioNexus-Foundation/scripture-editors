## [Unreleased]

Paratext 9's **Standard view** ported to Paratext 10: marker glyphs are rendered as editable text,
and typing, deleting, or picking a marker resolves through a marker-edit engine rather than being
refused. The public surface grew substantially; nothing was removed.

### Added

- `STANDARD_VIEW_MODE`, plus `"standard"` in `getDefaultViewMode()` and `viewModeToViewNames`.
- `EditorRef` methods: `isFocused`, `commitPendingMarkerEdits`, `setTransientInput`,
  `getMarkerMenuContext`, `applyMarkerMenuSelection`, `splitParagraphWithMarker`,
  `commitTypedMarker`, `commitTypedCloser`.
- `EditorRef.getNoteIndex` — the document-order index of the note with the given key, the
  coordinate a USJ-built notes list (e.g. a footnotes pane) addresses notes by.
- `EditorRef.getNoteKey` — the inverse: the key of the note at a document-order index, so a host
  that addresses notes by index can hand the editor the key `replaceEmbedUpdate` needs.
- `EditorRef.highlightNote` — applies PT9's selected-caller style (a thin top-and-bottom border,
  class `caller_highlight`) to one note's caller at a time, through `NoteCallerHighlightPlugin`;
  purely presentational, and `undefined` clears it.
- `generateUsjCss` — builds a project stylesheet from `StyleInfo`.
- `getMarkerMenuItems` / `getEnterMenuItems` / `filterAndRankItems` — the marker-menu item source and
  ranking a host needs to build its own marker palette.
- `defaultStyleInfo` and the `StyleInfo` / `MarkerStyleInfo` / `StyleType` types.
- `EditorOptions.styleInfo`, `EditorOptions.markerSettleDelayMs`,
  `ViewOptions.showParaMarkerPrefixes`, and the caller/separator fields on `UsjNodeOptions`.
- **Ctrl+Space removes character formatting from the selection.** On macOS this is ⌃Space rather than
  ⌘Space, which is Spotlight. It can collide with the macOS input-source switcher and with some IME
  on/off toggles; the handler declines while a composition is active.

### Changed

- `EditorRef.insertMarker` returns `string | undefined` (was `void`) — the created node's key.
- `NoteCallerOnClick` takes a 7th parameter, `getNoteIndex: () => number | undefined`.
- **Marker menu descriptions no longer carry the `(basic)` token.** `usfm.sty` marks commonly-used
  markers by appending `(basic)` to the description; that token is metadata, and hosts render
  `description` as the visible label, so it was reaching users as "Introduction prose paragraph
  (basic)". `MarkerMenuItem.description` is now the description without it. **The information is not
  lost — read `MarkerMenuItem.isBasic`**, which is still derived from the original description.
- `getUsj()` returns the settled document in editable marker modes. When nothing is pending and no
  transient input is declared it short-circuits to the previous behavior, so the other view modes are
  unaffected.

### Fixed

- The attribute-run hover color resolves against the host's `--foreground` instead of a fixed
  near-black, which was all but invisible against a dark theme.
- The in-editor marker menu no longer swallows modifier chords: a keystroke carrying Ctrl/Cmd/Alt
  while the menu is open closes the menu and reaches its normal handler instead of being appended to
  the filter.
- A marker flagged as unknown or invalid now carries an accessible description and a tooltip naming
  the problem, rather than communicating it through color alone.
- `applyUpdate` (and `replaceEmbedUpdate`, which goes through it) no longer pulls DOM focus into an
  editor that does not hold focus. Lexical reconciles the DOM selection after every commit, and
  setting a DOM selection inside a `contenteditable` focuses it, so a host editing a note in a
  separate editor lost its caret to the main editor on each apply. A focused editor still
  reconciles, and the explicit caret APIs (`focus`, `setSelection`, `selectNote`) are unchanged.
