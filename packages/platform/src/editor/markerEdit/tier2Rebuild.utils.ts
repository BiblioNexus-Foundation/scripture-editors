 * `$signatureOf` of the live scope, and both make it for their own load-bearing reason:
 *
 * - The MUTATING settle (`$rebuildParas` and its note/chapter siblings below) computes it on the
 *   serialized rebuild BEFORE `$parseSerializedNode`, so a refusal materializes NO live nodes.
 *   That is what makes a refused re-settle a true no-op: parse orphans count as dirty leaves,
 *   which turn a refusal into a real commit — reconciliation, a DOM selection round trip, and a
 *   follow-on caret-normalization commit that can displace the caret out from under an active
 *   gesture (observed: a caret parked in span content yanked to the paragraph glyph, so the next
 *   keystrokes landed outside the span).
 * - The READ-ONLY settle cannot parse at all (Lexical forbids creating nodes inside a `read()`),
 *   and without the refusal a rebuild the mutating settle would refuse as a no-op (its own
 *   displayed bytes are already what re-tokenizing them produces, once normalized — e.g. a
 *   structural NBSP separator and a user's own typed space both collapse to the same plain
 *   space) would get spliced into its OUTPUT, silently replacing the user's own
 *   currently-displayed bytes with a DIFFERENT-looking (though equivalent-by-signature) rebuild.
 *
 * One computation feeding both is also what keeps the two settles' refusal decisions from ever
 * drifting apart — a drift here is a fixed-point disagreement, i.e. the editor refusing to
 * converge.
 *
 * Never needs `$isRebuildSentinel`'s node-kind classification — NOT because a sentinel-class kind
 * (a note, an opaque block, a non-re-tokenizable milestone, a char span with unrecoverable
 * attributes) can never appear FRESH here: it can. An unknown marker typed inside note content,
 * for instance, tokenizes into a genuinely fresh "char" entry carrying `unknownAttributes`, which
 * this function's own "char" branch below walks structurally rather than collapsing to one
 * opaque character the way `$appendSignature` collapses its LIVE counterpart. The mirror stays
 * safe anyway: a freshly-emitted sentinel-class node is, by definition, content that was NOT
 * already sitting in the OLD live tree in that same opaque form, so `$signatureOf` of the old
 * content can never equal what this function produces for it — the comparison this function feeds
 * comes out UNEQUAL either way, which is exactly what correctly drives a splice instead of a
 * mistaken no-op refusal. A matching signature is the only outcome that would need this function
 * to classify a node identically to `$appendSignature`, and a fresh sentinel-class node can never
 * produce one against content that didn't already contain it.

/**
 * The re-tokenization SCOPE a node belongs to: the expanded note whose content contains it, the
 * editable chapter whose display bytes contain it, or
 * the paragraph that contains it — or `undefined` when it has neither (an opaque block interior,
 * where the bytes stay literal, or a detached node). The nearest Note or Para wins — a note inside
 * a paragraph is its own scope: the note node, its marker glyphs, and its caller are preserved
 * across a rebuild while only its content re-tokenizes.
 *
 * The walk runs to the DOCUMENT ROOT, not just to the first Note/Para match: a paragraph can itself
 * be nested inside an opaque block (a sidebar's own paragraphs — see `$buildParaFragment`'s matching
 * ancestor guard), so an `UnknownNode` anywhere between `node` and the root — even above the nearest
 * Note/Para — still means "opaque block interior", overriding whatever scope was found closer in.
 * The override applies just the same when the nearest scope found is a NOTE, not only a paragraph:
 * a well-formed, expanded note can itself live inside a sidebar, and an `UnknownNode` further out
 * still wins over it — matching the pend path's own full-chain literal-only guard
 * (`$inLiteralOnlyBlock`, markerEditTier2Trigger.utils.ts), which never pends a key whose divergence
 * could never settle in the first place.
 *
 * One scope is not an ancestor: a chapter's attribute markers sitting at DOCUMENT ROOT directly
 * adjacent to it (through only other such spans) settle through that CHAPTER's scope, because
 * only a re-tokenize that sees the `\c` and the `\ca`/`\cp` bytes TOGETHER can fold them back
 * onto it ({@link $chapterAdjacentAttributeNodes}, whose region `$rebuildChapter` rebuilds).
 * Without this arm the fold waited for a reload. Two shapes reach it:
 *
 * - a first-class `\ca`/`\cp` CHAR, which has no Note/Para/Chapter ancestor at all;
 * - a real `\cp` PARAGRAPH, which does have one — itself. Its own paragraph scope is what a
 *   `\cp` paragraph must NOT settle through: re-tokenizing `\cp 1` alone can only ever produce a
 *   `\cp` paragraph, so the chapter has to be in the fragment for the fold to be expressible at
 *   all. The chapter therefore OVERRIDES a paragraph scope that is the root child itself, while
 *   any scope found deeper in (a note inside that paragraph) still wins — it is the nearer
 *   scope, and its own rebuild is the right one.
 *
 * The single definition of scope, shared by the mutating settle below and the read-only settle in
 * virtualSettle.utils.ts. Both must route a given pending key to the SAME scope, or the settled USJ
 * a consumer reads and the structure a later real settle produces would be derived from different
 * regions of the document.

 * left for the caret to sit after. Settling that mid-composition is accept-then-discard (the
