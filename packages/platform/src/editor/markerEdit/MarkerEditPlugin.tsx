/**
 * The command behind the public `EditorRef.commitPendingMarkerEdits()` method — `Editor.tsx`
 * dispatches it when a host calls that method. Resolving a pending marker re-tokenizes its
 * edited text into finished structure; this command resolves every pending marker so the
 * serialized USJ matches what is on screen. Without it, a marker the user renamed but walked
 * away from mid-edit stays pending forever and serializes its OLD text.
 *
 * The resolve-everything rule has two carve-outs:
 *
 * - While the app-placed-caret suppression window is armed (a programmatic scrRef caret move —
 *   the "yank" — or an undo/redo restore), the ENTIRE pending set stays pending: nothing
 *   resolves. A forced commit during the window carries no user intent over the restored
 *   content — the host's debounced pre-save commit fires ~700ms after an undo, and resolving
 *   then would re-settle the explicitly-undone literal with no user input. Pending literals
 *   serialize as literal bytes, which ParatextData parses, so the save stays correct; the
 *   user's next in-editor gesture (click/keystroke) releases the window and settling resumes.
 * - Outside the window, the one exception is the node under the live caret — kept pending only
 *   while the editor holds DOM focus (a mid-typing pause must not settle under the user); an
 *   abandoned (blurred) edit settles fully.
 *
 * The caller's own obligations (e.g. do not call while a marker palette is open) are documented
 * on `EditorRef.commitPendingMarkerEdits`.

 * Runs `settle` inside the surrounding commit and marks that commit as a settle: it merges into

 *
 * A SETTLE IS NEVER ITS OWN UNDO ENTRY. Undo undoes what the USER did — a typed character, a
 * deletion — never a settle, so every settle joins the history entry of the edit that provoked it
 * and one Ctrl+Z takes the edit and its settle away together, landing on the content the user had
 * before that edit.
 *
 * Two things this replaces, both worth keeping in view. Only a settle that changed NOTHING used to
 * merge: a resolve pass that merely refused (a re-pended degradation literal after an undo, a
 * canonical attribute run) changes nothing visible, yet each refused rebuild probe still creates
 * parse orphans that count as dirty leaves — untagged, that commit pushes an undo entry restoring
 * an identical-looking document (one dead Ctrl+Z press) and wipes the redo stack. Still true, and
 * subsumed here. A settle that DID change something kept its own entry so undo could restore the
 * pre-settle literal bytes; that argument is weaker now that openers and closers are editable in
 * place, since a mistyped marker is corrected directly rather than by undoing back to a literal.
 * Weaker, not gone — the literal form is still the only way to edit some shapes as raw bytes, and
 * accepting that cost is a deliberate trade for an undo stack holding only user actions.
 *
 * The second tag is not decoration: the merge tag alone reads as "nothing to report" to
 * USJ-change consumers, and `DeltaOnChangePlugin` skips merge-tagged commits. Without it the
 * settled bytes would never refresh the cached USJ or reach the host as a delta, and the document
 * on screen would diverge from the document saved.
