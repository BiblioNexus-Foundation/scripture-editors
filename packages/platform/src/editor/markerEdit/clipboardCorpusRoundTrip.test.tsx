/**
 * Corpus-style copy→paste round trip: for every fixture in the shared USJ round-trip corpus
 * (`../adaptors/corpus/corpus-data.ts`, the same fixtures `corpus-round-trip.test.ts` uses for the
 * plain load→save round trip), load it into a Standard-view editor, select the chapter's own
 * content, dispatch `COPY_COMMAND`, paste the resulting `text/plain` into a FRESH editor holding
 * the same book/chapter header, settle, export USJ, and expect it to deep-equal the source. This
 * is the clipboard-specific sibling of that load→save sweep — it exercises `$selectionToUsfmText`
 * (copy) and `$handlePasteForStandardView` + Tier 2's re-tokenizer (paste) together, over the same
 * corpus, instead of the adaptors alone.
 *
 * The book/chapter header itself is never part of the copied SELECTION (Standard view always
 * copies out of an already-open chapter, never the header) and paste normalization deliberately
 * strips any `\c`/`\id` a paste DOES carry (see `whitespaceDisplay.plugin.utils.ts`), so the
 * target editor is seeded with the SAME header up front and the paste only has to reproduce the
 * chapter's CONTENT — matching how a real user would select and copy inside an already-open
 * chapter.
 *
 * `"periph"` is a named `it.skip` rather than a swept case: it is book-level front matter with no
 * chapter at all, so it does not fit "a single-chapter editor state" — there is no chapter-content
 * selection for it to exercise. Every other fixture is either swept clean or recorded in
 * `KNOWN_LOSSY` below with the exact byte-level divergence — none are silently dropped. All 21
 * fixtures run in well under a second; no sampling is needed.
 *
 * The OTHER USJ corpus in this repo, `libs/test-data/src/data/2sa.usj.ts` (141 paragraphs; IS
 * single-chapter — one top-level chapter object, despite the size), is deliberately NOT included
 * here. It was tried against this exact harness and does not round-trip clean: it hits the
 * `"sidebar (esb)"` gap below three times (2SA's own sidebar coverage), PLUS several additional,
 * unrelated fidelity gaps this sweep's one-construct-per-fixture design has no clean way to
 * itemize as a single byte diff (an empty `\b` blank-line paragraph folds into literal text inside
 * a `p` paragraph; a verse's derived `sid` attribute is dropped; a `\ref` cross-reference target
 * degrades differently than the corpus's own dedicated `ref` fixture above). `tier2Rebuild.corpus
 * .test.tsx` already exercises this exact fixture, but for a narrower, DIFFERENT property (an
 * unedited `$rebuildParas` call refusing as a fixed point) — that coverage does not include the
 * paste path (NBSP normalization, `\c`/`\id` strip, own-marker-wins dedup) this sweep does, so
 * excluding 2sa here is a real coverage gap, not a redundant re-test.

/**
 * Corpus fixtures the copy→paste round trip cannot currently reproduce byte-for-byte. Kept IN the
 * sweep as `it.skip` (never silently omitted) so a future engine fix un-skips them instead of a
 * blind gap going unnoticed; each reason is the short form of the diff, with the full byte-level
 * mechanism recorded in this file's neighboring comments and in the semantics doc's accepted-
 * asymmetries list.
 *
 * - **"cross-reference ref target"** — USJ's `<ref>` cross-reference-target wrapper carries no
 *   USFM byte representation anywhere (`unknownUsfm.utils.ts`'s own doc comment: "USJ invented
 *   this container, USFM never carried it... only its child text renders"). Source content
 *   `["See ", {type:"ref", loc:"GEN 1:1", content:["Genesis 1:1"]}, " for details."]` copies as
 *   plain `"See Genesis 1:1 for details."` with no marker bytes anywhere marking the wrapper's
 *   extent, so paste re-tokenizes it as ordinary prose: content
 *   `["See Genesis 1:1 for details."]`, the `ref` wrapper gone. Inherent to the construct — a raw
 *   USFM export of this same fixture has the identical gap, independent of clipboard mechanics.
 *
 * - **"sidebar (esb)"** — NOT a tokenizer gap: `usfmFragmentToUsj.ts` already implements the
 *   `\esb`/`\esbe` pairing (its `SIDEBAR_MARKER`/`SIDEBAR_END_MARKER` assembly case tracks an open
 *   sidebar across tokens and closes it on `\esbe`). The real mechanism is structural, upstream of
 *   tokenizing: a sidebar's nested `\p` child is a real `ParaNode`, and `$selectionToUsfmText` (the
 *   copy walker) inserts a `\n` before any non-inline `ElementNode` boundary it crosses — a
 *   `ParaNode` is non-inline, so a `\n` lands between `\esb \cat History\cat*` and the nested
 *   paragraph's own content, even though both came from ONE sidebar. On paste, the line replay
 *   dispatches an `INSERT_PARAGRAPH_COMMAND` for every `\n`, so that single `\n` turns into TWO
 *   sibling `ParaNode`s where the source had one sidebar wrapping one paragraph. Tier 2 then
 *   re-tokenizes strictly per paragraph — `$requestTier2ForNode` (tier2Rebuild.utils.ts), the only
 *   production call site, always invokes `$rebuildParas([current], context)` with a single-element
 *   array — so the tokenizer's "current open sidebar" state can never span the two separate
 *   `$rebuildParas` calls the two now-sibling paragraphs each trigger; each is tokenized alone, and
 *   the pairing that DOES exist in `usfmFragmentToUsj.ts` never gets the chance to run across both
 *   lines at once. Result: an UNCLOSED sidebar (`closed:"false"`, no content), the inner paragraph
 *   hoisted OUT to become a top-level sibling, and a stray EMPTY paragraph with marker `"esbe"`.
 *   Tables hit the identical mode — their rows and cells are real block-level `ElementNode`s
 *   (`ImmutableTableNode`/`ImmutableTableRowNode`/`ImmutableTableCellNode`), so the walker's
 *   non-inline-boundary rule fires for every one of them; see the "table with header and cells"
 *   entry below. A real fix means grouping a paste's newly-inserted SIBLING paragraphs that originated
 *   from one selection back into a single rebuild fragment before Tier 2 tokenizes — a Tier-2
 *   architecture change (rebuild granularity, not a per-paragraph tweak), genuinely out of this
 *   work item's scope. The byte-level corruption stays pinned here rather than fixed.
 *
 * - **"closed=false body char span (implicit close, no closer)"** — a `closed="false"` char span
 *   has, by definition, no closing marker byte anywhere in its own USFM. When such a span is not
 *   the last thing in its paragraph (`Tell the <char closed="false">Lord</char> plainly.`), the
 *   copied text (`\nd Lord plainly.`) carries no byte marking where the span's content ends and
 *   the trailing prose resumes, so paste has nothing to stop at "Lord" on — it swallows the rest
 *   of the paragraph into the span (`{marker:"nd", content:["Lord plainly."]}`, the top-level
 *   `" plainly."` string gone). Inherent to the encoding, not a paste-path regression — the
 *   sibling `"unclosed note (closed=false)"` fixture, whose unclosed span IS the last thing in its
 *   paragraph, has no such trailing content to lose and round-trips clean.
 *
 * - **"table with header and cells"** — the SAME rebuild-scoping gap as the sidebar entry above,
 *   reaching tables now that a table's rows and cells are real block-level `ElementNode`s
 *   (`ImmutableTableNode`/`ImmutableTableRowNode`/`ImmutableTableCellNode`) rather than the inline
 *   `UnknownNode`s they used to be. The copy walker inserts a `\n` at every non-inline element
 *   boundary it crosses, so one table copies out as eight lines (`\tr `, `\th1 Day`, `\th2 Tribe`,
 *   …); paste replays each line as its own paragraph, and Tier 2 re-tokenizes strictly per
 *   paragraph, so the `\tr`/`\th`/`\tc` assembly `usfmFragmentToUsj.ts` already implements never
 *   sees the whole table in one pass. Result: empty `table:row` wrappers and the cells stranded as
 *   sibling paragraphs. The fix is the same one the sidebar entry names — grouping a paste's
 *   newly-split sibling paragraphs back into one rebuild fragment — and is equally out of scope.
 *
 * - **"milestones (ts)"** — a COMPOUND of two deliberate behaviors, neither of them a byte-level
 *   copy or normalization defect: the copied text is byte-correct
 *   (`\p \ts-s\*\v 1 Translator section text.\ts-e\*`), and pasting it into a host with NO marker
 *   prefix of its own round-trips clean. A milestone whose rebuild would EJECT content deliberately
 *   does NOT settle inside the commit that produced it (`markerEditTier2Trigger.utils.ts`:
 *   rearranging the line under a caret the user is still on is worse than waiting) — it pends until
 *   caret departure. But the own-marker-prefix dedup (`$withoutRedundantOwnPrefix`,
 *   `tier2Rebuild.utils.ts`) is armed only for the PASTE's own update, so the later
 *   departure-triggered settle no longer knows the fragment came from a paste and takes the typed
 *   path instead: the host's own `\p ` glyph and the pasted line's `\p ` literal both survive as
 *   two paragraphs, the first of them empty. Closing it means giving the dedup's arm a lifetime
 *   that spans the deferred settle — a paste-provenance change, not a tokenizer one, and out of
 *   scope here.
 *
 * - **"paragraph-leading space (display rule)"** — ACCEPTED normalization, matching Paratext 9,
 *   not a bug: isolated with a minimal non-corpus repro, pasting the literal text `"\p  X"`
 *   (marker, its own required separator, and a SECOND, real content-leading space) into a fresh
 *   empty `"\p"` host produces `"\p X"` — one space, not two. The mechanism is
 *   `consumeSeparator()` (`usfmFragmentToUsj.ts`), whose own comment says exactly this: "Consume
 *   the separator whitespace after an opening marker (PT9 skips it) — all leading whitespace, not
 *   just a single space." That mirrors Paratext 9's own `NormalizeUsfm` re-tokenization pass
 *   (documented above under "Paratext 9 Reference Behavior": "whitespace collapse, newlines
 *   inserted before paragraph/verse markers"), which likewise collapses a whitespace run after a
 *   marker during paste's reformat pipeline — P10 doing the same is parity, not a divergence.
 *   Corpus symptom: copying `<para style="p"> Leading space precedes this text.</para>` (source
 *   content `" Leading space precedes this text."`) round-trips through paste to
 *   `"Leading space precedes this text."` — the leading space is gone, same as it would be in P9.
 *   Kept in `KNOWN_LOSSY` (the byte-level comparison genuinely differs) but NOT a fix candidate.
