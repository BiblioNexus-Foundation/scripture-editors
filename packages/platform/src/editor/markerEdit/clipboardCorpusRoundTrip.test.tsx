/**
 * Corpus-style copy→paste round trip: for every fixture in the shared USJ round-trip corpus
 * (`../adaptors/corpus/corpus-data.ts`, the same fixtures `corpus-round-trip.test.ts` uses for the
 * plain load→save round trip), load it into a Standard-view editor, select the chapter's own
 * content, dispatch `COPY_COMMAND`, paste the resulting `text/plain` into a FRESH editor holding
 * the same book/chapter header, settle, export USJ, and expect it to deep-equal the source. This
 * is the clipboard-specific sibling of that load→save sweep — it exercises `$selectionToUsfmText`
 * (copy) and `$handlePasteForStandardView` + Tier 2's re-tokenizer (paste) together, over the same
 * corpus, instead of the adaptors alone.
 *
 * The book/chapter header itself is never part of the copied SELECTION (Standard view always
 * copies out of an already-open chapter, never the header) and paste normalization deliberately
 * strips any `\c`/`\id` a paste DOES carry (see `whitespaceDisplay.plugin.utils.ts`), so the
 * target editor is seeded with the SAME header up front and the paste only has to reproduce the
 * chapter's CONTENT — matching how a real user would select and copy inside an already-open
 * chapter.
 *
 * `"periph"` is a named `it.skip` rather than a swept case: it is book-level front matter with no
 * chapter at all, so it does not fit "a single-chapter editor state" — there is no chapter-content
 * selection for it to exercise. Every other fixture is either swept clean or recorded in
 * `KNOWN_LOSSY` below with the exact byte-level divergence — none are silently dropped.
 *
 * The repo's OTHER USJ corpus, `libs/test-data/src/data/2sa.usj.ts`, is swept too — see the
 * `"real-world multi-construct fixture (2sa)"` describe at the bottom of this file for what it adds
 * and for the one attribute it cannot carry. `tier2Rebuild.corpus.test.tsx` already exercises that
 * fixture, but for a narrower, DIFFERENT property (an unedited `$rebuildParas` call refusing as a
 * fixed point) that does not cover the paste path (NBSP normalization, `\c`/`\id` strip,
 * own-marker-wins dedup) this sweep does.
 *
 * The whole file, 2sa included, runs in about a second; no sampling is needed.

/**
 * Corpus fixtures the copy→paste round trip cannot currently reproduce byte-for-byte. Kept IN the
 * sweep as `it.skip` (never silently omitted) so a future engine fix un-skips them instead of a
 * blind gap going unnoticed; each reason is the short form of the diff, with the full byte-level
 * mechanism recorded in this file's neighboring comments and in the semantics doc's accepted-
 * asymmetries list.
 *
 * - **"cross-reference ref target"** — USJ's `<ref>` cross-reference-target wrapper carries no
 *   USFM byte representation anywhere (`unknownUsfm.utils.ts`'s own doc comment: "USJ invented
 *   this container, USFM never carried it... only its child text renders"). Source content
 *   `["See ", {type:"ref", loc:"GEN 1:1", content:["Genesis 1:1"]}, " for details."]` copies as
 *   plain `"See Genesis 1:1 for details."` with no marker bytes anywhere marking the wrapper's
 *   extent, so paste re-tokenizes it as ordinary prose: content
 *   `["See Genesis 1:1 for details."]`, the `ref` wrapper gone. Inherent to the construct — a raw
 *   USFM export of this same fixture has the identical gap, independent of clipboard mechanics.
 *
 * - **"closed=false body char span (implicit close, no closer)"** — a `closed="false"` char span
 *   has, by definition, no closing marker byte anywhere in its own USFM. When such a span is not
 *   the last thing in its paragraph (`Tell the <char closed="false">Lord</char> plainly.`), the
 *   copied text (`\nd Lord plainly.`) carries no byte marking where the span's content ends and
 *   the trailing prose resumes, so paste has nothing to stop at "Lord" on — it swallows the rest
 *   of the paragraph into the span (`{marker:"nd", content:["Lord plainly."]}`, the top-level
 *   `" plainly."` string gone). Inherent to the encoding, not a paste-path regression — the
 *   sibling `"unclosed note (closed=false)"` fixture, whose unclosed span IS the last thing in its
 *   paragraph, has no such trailing content to lose and round-trips clean.
 *
 * - **"paragraph-leading space (display rule)"** — ACCEPTED normalization, matching Paratext 9,
 *   not a bug: isolated with a minimal non-corpus repro, pasting the literal text `"\p  X"`
 *   (marker, its own required separator, and a SECOND, real content-leading space) into a fresh
 *   empty `"\p"` host produces `"\p X"` — one space, not two. The mechanism is
 *   `consumeSeparator()` (`usfmFragmentToUsj.ts`), whose own comment says exactly this: "Consume
 *   the separator whitespace after an opening marker (PT9 skips it) — all leading whitespace, not
 *   just a single space." That mirrors Paratext 9's own `NormalizeUsfm` re-tokenization pass
 *   (documented above under "Paratext 9 Reference Behavior": "whitespace collapse, newlines
 *   inserted before paragraph/verse markers"), which likewise collapses a whitespace run after a
 *   marker during paste's reformat pipeline — P10 doing the same is parity, not a divergence.
 *   Corpus symptom: copying `<para style="p"> Leading space precedes this text.</para>` (source
 *   content `" Leading space precedes this text."`) round-trips through paste to
 *   `"Leading space precedes this text."` — the leading space is gone, same as it would be in P9.
 *   Kept in `KNOWN_LOSSY` (the byte-level comparison genuinely differs) but NOT a fix candidate.
