/**
 * Tier 2 triggers for literal backslash text: typed or
 * pasted USFM that lands as plain TextNode content rather than being routed
 * through a MarkerNode/VerseNode transform. Lexical dispatches node
 * transforms by exact node type, so this transform never fires for
 * MarkerNode/VerseNode subclasses -- TextSpacingPlugin relies on the same
 * fact. A backslash sequence completed by a space/NBSP separator or a `*`
 * closer re-tokenizes immediately; an unterminated one waits in
 * `pendingKeys` for Enter/blur/caret-departure via `$resolvePendingMarkers`.
 * Attribute-run text (textType "attribute") is a third case: it never
 * re-tokenizes from here, regardless of backslashes or termination-looking
 * content, and pends whenever its own run diverges from what the owner's
 * state calls for — see the attribute branch below. Plain `|…`
 * content bounded by a CLOSER is a fourth case: it carries
 * no backslash, so the immediate path never fires, yet it is a pending
 * attribute edit (PT9 re-parses `|…` before an explicit closer), so it pends
 * for the same caret-departure settle rather than being discarded as inert text.
 * The closer is the enclosing char span's own closing glyph, or a leftover
 * unmatched closing marker sitting right after the run — the shape a milestone's
 * ejection leaves behind, whose repair the tokenizer folds back in.
 * Typed `//` is a fifth case: USFM's discretionary line break (optbreak) carries
 * no backslash or pipe either, but the tokenizer maps it to an optbreak wherever
 * plain text appears, so it pends for the same caret-departure settle.
 * A value typed into an empty `\va`/`\vp` SOURCE span (the settled empty form,
 * displayed `\va \va*`) is a sixth case: it carries no backslash or pipe either, but the
 * span rides in the owning verse's run position, so the tokenizer's attrCapture folds the
 * typed bytes back onto the verse's altnumber/pubnumber on the next re-tokenize — it pends
 * for the same caret-departure settle.
