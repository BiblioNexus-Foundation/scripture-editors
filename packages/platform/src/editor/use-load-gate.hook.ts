/**
 * Defers imperative work that has to address the loaded document until the load carrying it has
 * settled.
 *
 * `LoadStatePlugin` commits USJ from a microtask, and `editor.setEditorState()` replaces the whole
 * state, so an operation issued while a load is in flight either can't resolve its target or is
 * thrown away by the commit that follows. Callers shouldn't have to know that: they hold a ref and
 * may reasonably use it the moment they have one.
 *
 * When no load is pending the operation runs immediately, i.e. exactly as before. When one is, the
 * operation runs at the first settle with nothing else loading or requested - so it addresses a
 * live document, and an operation that can never succeed still fails there rather than waiting.
 *
 * @param logger - Reports work that no longer has a caller to fail to: a deferred operation that
 *   throws, and operations still queued when the editor unmounts.
