    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="RUT 1:1" />In the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to live in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons. <verse eid="RUT 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="RUT 1:2" />The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi. The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into the country of Moab and lived there. <verse eid="RUT 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="RUT 1:3" />Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left with her two sons. <verse eid="RUT 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="RUT 1:4" />They took for themselves wives of the women of Moab. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years. <verse eid="RUT 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="RUT 1:5" />Mahlon and Chilion both died, and the woman was bereaved of her two children and of her husband. <verse eid="RUT 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="RUT 1:6" />Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab; for she had heard in the country of Moab how Yahweh<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:6 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">“Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</char></note> had visited his people in giving them bread. <verse eid="RUT 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="RUT 1:7" />She went out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her. They went on the way to return to the land of Judah. <verse eid="RUT 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="RUT 1:8" />Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go, return each of you to her mother’s house. May Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. <verse eid="RUT 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="RUT 1:9" />May Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband.”</para>

If I should say, ‘I have hope,’ if I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons, <verse eid="RUT 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="RUT 1:13" />would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me seriously for your sakes, for Yahweh’s hand has gone out against me.”<verse eid="RUT 1:13" /></para>
