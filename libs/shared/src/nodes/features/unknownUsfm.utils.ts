/**
 * Unknown-node USFM byte rendering: the single place that owns HOW an `UnknownNode`'s opening
 * marker, attribute, and closing marker bytes are computed for read-only display. Sibling of
 * attributeDisplay.utils.ts (char/verse attribute display runs), following the same owning-module
 * shape, but for a different tree: `UnknownNode`'s kinds (figure, table/table:row/table:cell,
 * sidebar, periph, ref, optbreak) carry no USFM byte representation anywhere in the tree —
 * markers and attributes are simply invisible today. The renderer that flanks a node's existing
 * content children with the bytes this module computes lives elsewhere; this module is the pure
 * byte-computation function it calls.
 *
 * ## Why these bytes carry no round-trip obligation
 *
 * Every kind here stays a Tier-2 sentinel — unlike char spans and verses (attributeDisplay.utils.ts),
 * which grew live display runs that re-tokenize on edit. These bytes only need to be CORRECT
 * USFM, not byte-identical to whatever produced the node; nothing here ever re-tokenizes back
 * into node state, so there is no cache to keep honest and no sync to register.
 *
 * ## Per-kind shapes
 *
 * All four parts are OPAQUE bytes for the consumer to concatenate around the node's content,
 * never to parse. The `attributes` part carries only bytes that belong BETWEEN the opening and
 * the content (sidebar's `\cat …\cat*` marker run, periph's marker-line pipe pairs; `""` for
 * every other kind). USFM pipe attributes on span-shaped kinds (the generic default, figure)
 * come AFTER content, directly before the closer, so those kinds populate `closingAttributes`
 * instead — kept as its own part (rather than folded into `closing`) so the consumer can style
 * the `|…` run dimmer than the closer glyph, matching PT9's attribute-run display. Concatenating
 * `closingAttributes + closing` reproduces the exact same bytes a single `closing` string used
 * to carry.
 *
 * - **Generic default** (any kind without a special case below): `\{marker} ` opening, a
 *   `closingAttributes` of {@link canonicalAttributeText} named pairs — always explicit
 *   `name="value"`, never the default-attribute collapse, because unknown kinds carry no
 *   StyleInfo default to collapse against — and a `closing` of `\{marker}*` (the char-span shape:
 *   `\zzz content|foo="bar"\zzz*`).
 * - **optbreak** — PT9 renders `\optbreak` as the literal token `//`, not a marker: the opening
 *   IS the bare text `//`, with no attributes and no closing glyph.
 * - **figure** — USFM 3.0 puts the caption first (`\fig caption|src="…"\fig*`), so the attribute
 *   bytes go in `closingAttributes`, ahead of the `closing` glyph. USX/USJ's `file` attribute is
 *   USFM's `src` (the tokenizer performs the same rename in the other direction;
 *   usfmFragmentToUsj.ts); rendering reverses it back so the bytes match what a `\fig …\fig*`
 *   span actually carries in the file.
 * - **table / table:row / table:cell** — tables have no USFM pipe-attribute syntax at all; a
 *   cell's `align`/`colspan` are ENCODED in the marker name itself (`\thc3-4`), never rendered
 *   as attribute bytes. The container contributes no bytes of its own; a row opens with `\tr `;
 *   a cell opens with its own marker, re-encoding a `colspan` back into the span suffix the
 *   tokenizer trimmed off (marker `thc3` + colspan `2` → `\thc3-4 `; see
 *   {@link tableCellMarkerWithSpan}); neither ever closes.
 * - **sidebar** — `\esb`/`\esbe` bracket the block. A `category` attribute is not a pipe
 *   attribute at all but its own char-shaped marker directly after `\esb`
 *   (`\esb \cat Missions\cat*`), mirroring how the tokenizer folds a `\cat` onto a receptive
 *   sidebar (usfmFragmentToUsj.ts).
 * - **periph** — `alt` is a text-content attribute: its value renders as literal marker content
 *   right after `\periph` (`\periph Title`) rather than a pipe attribute; any remaining
 *   attributes (e.g. `id`) are ordinary named pairs. `periph` is an open-ended division marker,
 *   so it never closes.
 * - **ref** — a generated wrapper around cross-reference target text; USJ invented this
 *   container, USFM never carried it, so it contributes no bytes at all — only its child text
 *   renders, as-is.
 *
 * ## Unterminated constructs render no closer
 *
 * Cutting across every kind above: a construct the source never terminated (`closed="false"`) has
 * no closing bytes in the file, so it displays none. Char spans already work this way — see
 * `$charClosingGlyph` (attributeDisplay.utils.ts) — and the rule is the same one for the same
 * reason: a closer shown for bytes the document does not contain is a byte the user can neither
 * edit away nor save.
